Construction started 2008 next to Abu Dhabi International Airport. Originally planned completion 2016, pushed to 2020-2025 due to global financial crisis; building to demand not speculating empty buildings. Estimated construction cost $18.7-19.8 billion. Abu Dhabi invested $2.4 billion smart city initiatives since 2015. Currently 4,000+ residents, ultimate capacity ~50,000. Hosts headquarters International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). 1,000+ public/private organizations based in city (6 sq km economic free zone). Community powered partly by on-site renewable energy, constructed using sustainable materials. Eco-friendly buildings designed reducing energy/water consumption minimum 40%; some exceed this. Three net-zero energy buildings under construction producing as much energy as consumed. Masdar Green REIT portfolio valued AED 980M (USD 267M) December 2021 with 3.3% valuation gain. Part of UAE long-term plan achieving net zero 2050 and diversifying economy beyond oil. Hub for cleantech companies: Siemens, GE, IRENA, Advanced Technology Research Council.

Investment: 300 million pesos (~$18M USD). Benefits 1.3M+ total users (students + staff). Majority in basic education schools, covering all 16 Alcaldías (boroughs). Annual capture capacity: 918 million liters alleviating pressure on traditional water sources. Systems enable water for showering, washing, cooking where public supply doesn't reach or is unreliable. Before program, residents collected rainwater with makeshift systems filtered through cotton cloths or bought water from tanker trucks (pipas) carrying in jerry cans. RHS consists of receptacle 'Tlaloc' (named after Aztec rain god) filtering dust before water runs into 5,000-liter tank distributed to local network. First 2-3 downpours pass through for cleaner harvested water. Installation cost ~$270 per system.
